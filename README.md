# realm-behaviorpack

A minecraft behavior pack adding custom items and other cool stuff.

Depends on [realm-resourcepack](https://github.com/RealHackerman/realm-resourcepack)

## Setup
It is recommended to create a new world when updating to a new major release of this pack.

When using this pack in a world for the first time, run the command
    /function init
otherwise artifacts will not work correctly
